  "content": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>h, Utopia, Ozarka, Oasis, artesia, ambrosia. Taken together, the names of the state’s five leading water companies conjure up images of a perfect land, with rolling hills protected by a surrounding desert, where deep wells brim with the refreshment of the gods. But what do their products have in common besides those wonderfully evocative marketing labels?</p><p>Quite a lot. Whether from isolated ranch-country springs or urban water supplies, they all undergo state-approved filtrations that add an extra margin of purity without the chlorinated taste of city water. All except ambrosia, whose source of spring water varies, offer middling amounts of minerals that are usually considered healthful and are chemically similar to San antonio’s public water supply. Which brand one chooses is a matter of taste. What makes consumers want to pay for these products is the idea that bottled water may contain fewer pollutants than tap water.</p><p>Urban water emerges from the plant dosed with chlorine to kill bacteria. Then it flows by way of underground conduits, themselves a source of possible contamination, through miles of earth exposed to lawn fertilizers and pesticides. News of old, undiscovered dump sites and Superfund cleanups has made consumers anxious about the recommended eight glasses of water a day. That anxiety translates into profits for the bottledwater companies.</p><p>Chester Rosson</p><p><strong>Brands</strong></p><p><strong>Types</strong></p><p><strong>Source</strong></p><p><strong>Minerals</strong></p><p><strong>Size, Price</strong></p><p><strong>Processing</strong></p><img /><p>Still spring water</p><p>Buck Springs, in Jasper County, bottled in Houston</p><p>Tds*: 17 milligrams per liter+, sodiumfree, low in minerals</p><p>1 gallon, 89ȼ-99ȼ; 2 1/2 gallons, $1.49-$1.69</p><p>carbon filter, ozonation</p><p>Drinking water</p><p>Harris County (Coastal Sands aquifer), bottled at source</p><p>Tds: 64 mg per liter, sodiumfree. moderate in minerals</p><p>1 gallon, 690; 2 1/2 gallons, $1.29</p><p>deionization, carbon filter, ozonation</p><img /><p>Drinking water</p><p>San antonio (Edwards aquifer), bottled at source</p><p>Tds: 312 mg per liter, sodium-free, high in minerals</p><p>1 gallon. 800-900; 2 1/2 gallons, $1.89-$2.29; 32 ounces, 850-950</p><p>sand filter, activated charcoal filter, 5micron filter, ozonation</p><p>Carbonated well water</p><p>same</p><p>same</p><p>7 ounces, $2.09-82.49 per six pack; 32 ounces, 850-950</p><p>same, plus carbonation</p><img /><p>Still spring water</p><p>Tahuaya, in Bell County, bottled in Waco</p><p>Tds: 265 mg per liter*, sodium-free, high in minerals</p><p>1 gallon, 890</p><p>carbon filter, reverse osmosis, ozonation</p><p>Drinking water</p><p>Mt.
