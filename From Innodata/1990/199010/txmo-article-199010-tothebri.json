As tangible symbols of an untarnished ideal of physical prowess, these awards also hold their own as an art form. The trophies shown on the following pages don’t necessarily represent well-known athletic conquests. Some are so ancient that both the winner and the achievement have been long forgotten. As each season passes and glory days recede, most universities end up with more awards than they can possibly show off. Up-to-date plastic and composite-wood versions edge out their glamorous silver or bronze predecessors on the shelves.</p><p>In some instances old loving cups are crammed into boxes, he neglected in storage closets, or collect dust in secluded display cases. By dusting the trophies off and shining them up, we recall an era when good sports always won and victories were always brilliant.</p><p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHS By Wyatt Mcspadden</strong></p><img /><p><strong>RICE University</strong><em>1931</em> Southwest Conference Quarter-Mile Relay Champions</p><img /><p><strong>Baylor University</strong></p><p><em>1932</em> Southwest Conference Basketball Champions</p><img /><p><strong>TEXAS Christian University </strong><em>1934 </em>Southwest Conference Basketball Champions</p><img /><p><strong>RICE University</strong><em>1926</em> Southwest Conference Relay Champions</p><img /><p><strong>TEXAS A&M University</strong><em>date unknown</em> event unknown</p><img /><p><strong>SOUTHERN Methodist University </strong><em>1938 </em>Southwest Conference Individual Golf Championship</p><img /><p><strong>UNIVERSITY Of Texas</strong><em>date unknown</em> TCU Track and Field Day Winner</p><img /><p><strong>TEXAS A&M University </strong><em>1910 </em>Singles Tennis Tournament Winner</p><img /><p><strong>UNIVERSITY Of Texas</strong><em>1916</em> Texas Intercollegiate athletic association event unknown</p><img /><p><strong>RICE University </strong><em>1931 </em>Southwestern Recreation Track and Field Meet</p><img /><p><strong>SOUTHERN Methodist University </strong><em>1931 </em>Southwest Conference Golf Champions</p><img /><p><strong>BAYLOR University </strong><em>1950 </em>NCAA Basketball Fourth Place</p>",
