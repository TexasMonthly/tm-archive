  "excerpt": "Burns roamed Texas doing odd jobs. One day he ambled into a museum carrying drawings he’d made along the way—and ended up a celebrity.",
  "kicker": "",
  "word_count": 251,
  "content": "<p><em>Wandering about Texas, living by manual labor, artist Andy Burns portrayed a world of hard jobs, lonely hours, and vibrant streets.</em></p><p>Andy Burns’s life is the stuff American legends are made of. He’s the anonymous folksinger whose lyrics lionize the common man—but Burns’s lyrics are composed with paper and colored pencils. He’s the mysterious stranger who performs some heroic deed and then steals off into the night, the Lone Ranger of the art world.</p><p>Burns was born in Houston thirty-odd years ago, but he spent a good part ol his youth in places like Colorado and New Mexico. He came back to Texas as a young man though, and knocked around the state, working as a dishwasher in El Paso, a meat packer in Abilene, a roughneck on a Galveston offshore rig. After he’d been at each job for a while, he would persuade his boss to give him a little time oft to sketch the other workers. Then one day in 1978 he turned up on the doorstep of Houston’s Contemporary Arts Museum with a sheaf of drawings torn out ot his thirteenby seventeen-inch sketchbook. The Cam’s director liked the drawings so well that she gave Burns a one-man show, just like that.</p><p>Andy Burns, itinerant worker, is a poet of the commonplace in the best tradition of American folk art. And in the best tradition of American folk heroes, he has quietly vanished again—into the wilds of Colorado, legend has it.</p><img/><p><em>Street scene, Juárez</em></p><img/><p><em>Hotel lobby, El Paso</em></p><img/><p><em>Roughnecks, Galveston</em></p><img/><p><em>Meat packers, Abilene</em></p><img/><p><em>Lunch counter, El Paso</em></p>",
