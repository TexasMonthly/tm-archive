But when it comes to bathroomdoor decor, why stop at merely differentiating between genders? ■ The savviest Texas restaurateurs have learned that with a little extra effort, they can make a statement or make you smile. Often door designers rely on thematic puns, as in the multitude of seaside spots with doors tagged “Gulls” and “Buoys.” Sometimes door decor is simply a reflection of an ethnic motif: half of the TexMex joints in the state sport doors labeled “Damas” and “Caballeros.” ■ That’s a regrettable situation in the eyes of a traditionalist like Karnes City restaurateur al Pawelek. His doors plainly state “Ladies” and “Men” because, he says, “we’re in america, and that’s the way it should be.” ■ But the real door artists go for a particular form of comic relief, not known for its sophistication. Think of austin’s muchlamented, long-departed Jake’s, which earned a small part of its rowdy notoriety from its restroom doors: they read “Setters” and “Pointers.” Now that’s the kind of bathroom humor we like.</p><p><em>Jerry Jeanmard is a designer from Houston.</em></p><p>Photography By Wyatt Mcspadden, Background Tile And Polaroid Borders Photographed By Rick PATRick</p><img /><p>Baby Routh Dallas</p><img /><p>Nash d’amico Pasta & Clam Bar <em>Galveston</em></p><p>Haby's Hot Pit BBQ <em>Uvalde</em></p><p>Grotto Ristorante <em>Houston</em></p><img /><p>Deep Ellum Cafe <em>Dallas</em></p><p>Goode Company Texas Seafood <em>Houston</em></p><p>Chuy's South <em>austin</em></p>",
