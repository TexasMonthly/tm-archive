  "content": "<img/><img/><p>Photography By Geoff Winningham</p><p>To photograph homecoming queens, Geoff Winningham went to 24 high schools across the state—large urban ones like Highland Park in Dallas and tiny ones in towns like Wink. He chose some of the towns because of their names — Munday and Littlefield, for instance—and others because they had some special meaning for him: Mount Vernon is the hometown of Don Meredith, and Larry MeMurtry came from archer City. When Winningham called some of the bigger schools, he was surprised to find that no one seemed to know who the homecoming queen was and that whatever traditions there had been were long forgotten. But in small towns, particularly in North and Northwest Texas, Winningham discovered that homecoming hadn't changed. The football players still vote —not for the prettiest girl but for the girl they like best. There's still the parade, the bonfire, the big game, and the dance. Everyone who ever lived in the town still comes home, and everyone feels involved when the football team presents the queen and her court. The captain gives the queen the traditional kiss. It's a time of renewal, a sort of harvest festival when the pick of the youth, the pride of the crop, stands before the town.</p><p><em>LaTrecia McCarty ♦ Littlefield</em></p><img/><p><em>Stacy Jacobs ♦ Highland Park , Dallas</em></p><img/><p><em>Amanda Demny ♦ East Bernard</em></p><img/><p><em>Denise abron ♦ Daingerfield</em></p><img/><p><em>Karen Eggleston ♦ Wink</em></p><img/><img/><p><em>Yvonne Stryk</em> ♦ <em>Flatoma</em></p><img/><p><em>Sherry Timms ♦ Seagraves</em></p><img/><p><em>Pam Welch Munday</em></p><img/><p><em>Kelly Fenton Mount Vernon</em></p><img/><p><em>Sonya Johnson Beaumont French</em></p><img/><p><em>Tami Nichols ♦ archer City</em></p>",
