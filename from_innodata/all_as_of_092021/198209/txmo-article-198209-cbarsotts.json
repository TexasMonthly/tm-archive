  "content": "<p>Charles Barsotti grew up in San Antonio. He has been drawing cartoons almost all of his life, and today his work appears in the <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Playboy,</em> and other publications. His latest book is <em>Kings Don’t Carry Money. </em>Recently he created the cowboy character seen on these pages. “The little guy has a beard,” Barsotti says, “and I grew up in the McCarthy era, when everyone looked the same or got killed. Then Willie Nelson came along and wore pigtails, by God, and an earring, and broke all the rules. I like the idea of this independent little fellow, though I don’t think he’s Willie Nelson. I also like the cross-cultural idea of a cowboy who likes Sibelius and Jean-Pierre Rampal.”</p><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img />",
