Cober’s drawings-he has also sketched the 1980 presidential campaign and the visit of Pope John Paul Ii to the United States - resurrect a neglected art form. A sketchbook enables the artist to record his impressions in both pictures and words. It is personal in a way the camera can never be. In Cober’s hands, the ancient art of the sketchbook is the perfect medium for an ancient land, one whose civilization is older than Texas.</p><img/><img/><img/><img/><img/><img/>",
