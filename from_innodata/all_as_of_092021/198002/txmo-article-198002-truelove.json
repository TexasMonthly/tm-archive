Kissing someone you love has got to be the best feeling in the world, and often it’s the only right way to say I love you. Kisses are never flowery or verbose, they’re never studied or stilted. Every kiss that comes from the heart is perfect. A kiss can be plain or fancy, long or short, a whisper or a smack. And not only do they feel good, smell good, taste good, and sound good, they even <em>look</em> good, as these photos by Janice Rubin clearly show.</p><img /><img /><img /><img />",
