  "content": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span> remember seeing this drawing for the first time in the back of a Batman comic book when I was six. It was an ad for one of those art correspondence schools. I couldn’t read all the promises it made, but that didn’t matter. I had to draw that cowboy. My mother drew it too. Later, we entered hers-in my name. After a few very long weeks the reply came. I was too young for the school, it said, but the drawing showed real talent. And even though it was my mom’s talent, not mine, I kept on drawing.</p><p>I guess almost every kid who thought he could draw did this; it was an introduction to both the commercial and the competitive sides of art. We’ve asked twenty of the finest illustrators around to draw that same cowboy. We’re pretty excited about the results, but then, for most of these artists, it wasn’t their first time.</p><p>Special thanks to art Instruction Schools, Inc.</p><img/><p><strong>ANDRZEJ Dudzinski</strong></p><img/><p><strong>MATT Mahurin</strong></p><img/><p><strong>HENRIK Drescher</strong></p><img/><p><strong>BRAD Holland</strong></p><img/><p><strong>JOSÉ Cruz</strong></p><img/><p><strong>SUE Llewellyn</strong></p><img/><p><strong>VIVIENNE Flesher</strong></p><img/><p><strong>ELWOOD H.
